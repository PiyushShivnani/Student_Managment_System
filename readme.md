# Student Management System

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Student Management System. It allows users to manage student records by performing various operations such as adding students, searching for students, removing students, updating student details, and displaying the list of students.

## Features

1. *Add Student:* This feature allows the user to add student records to the system. The user can enter the student's name, roll number, and marks for two subjects.

2. *Search Student:* Users can search for a student by entering the student's roll number. The system will display the student's details if found.

3. *Remove Student:* Users have the option to remove a student from the system. They can either delete all student records or remove a specific student by providing the roll number.

4. *Update Student:* This feature enables users to update the details of a student. They can enter the roll number of the student whose details they want to update, and then provide the new information for the student's name and marks in two subjects.

5. *Display Students:* Users can view the list of all students stored in the system. The system will display each student's name, roll number, and marks for two subjects.

## Usage

To use the Student Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3 or above).

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the source code files.

4. Run the following command to start the program:

   
   python student_management_system.py
   

5. The program will display a menu with options to perform different operations. Enter the number corresponding to your desired operation.

6. Follow the on-screen prompts to add, search, remove, update, or display student records.

7. To exit the program, select the "Exit" option from the menu.
